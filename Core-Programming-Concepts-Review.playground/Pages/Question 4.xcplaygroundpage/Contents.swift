 # Question 4
 
 Imagine you are creating an app to track food usage in the LCS Dining Hall to help reduce food waste.
 
 The kitchen staff and TOD will use your app to track the following information:
 
 * Diners: the total number of people who ate at a single meal
 * Salad bar: the total quantity of salad bar items consumed by mass (in kilograms)
 * Soup: the total volume of soup consumed by mass (in litres)
 * Main course: the total mass of main course (hot items) consumed by mass (in kilograms)
 * Pizza oven: the total mass of items consumed that were made in the pizza oven, by mass (in kilograms)
 * Date: The date of the meal (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 * Time frame: The time frame of the meal (e.g.: 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM)
 
 Declare constants for each of these items, **but be sure to choose the appropriate data type in each case**.
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for each constant.

// Answer question 4 below
let dinner = 200
let saladBar = 20.0
let soup = 20.0
let mainCourse = 12.0
let pizzaOven = 10.0
let date = "Thursday, January 18, 2018"
let timeFrame = "11:30 AM to 1:00 PM"
print("I use double for the salad bar, main course and pizza oven, because it is asking the mass of the food. The mass requires the decimals. There's no half man, so the dinner is integer. The date and the time frame are the sentences, so they are string.")

    * *Thinking*
        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.
